# TPUv1: Introduced in 2016, this was the first version of Google's TPU.
# TPUv2: Introduced in 2017, this version brought improvements over the first version.
# TPUv3: Introduced in 2018, this version continued the trend of improvements.
# TPUv4: Introduced in 2021, this version is faster and uses less power than the Nvidia A100.
# TPUv5: Introduced in 2023, this is the latest version as of my knowledge until 2021.
# Edge TPU: Introduced in July 2018, the Edge TPU is a smaller, low-power version designed for edge computing.
